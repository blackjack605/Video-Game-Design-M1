I have completed all requirements of the project. I created a camera with post processing effects. I added a separate menu scene with buttons that go to the playable scene along with a button that ends the application. I then added an in game pause menu that can be open or closed with escape with buttons to restart the scene or close the application. I then added a ball that can be collected by anyone with the ball collector script and makes hasBall true.

 No resources were acquired outside of the camera assets required by the project.

 The program does not require any special instructions to run, simply press the buttons and collect the pink ball with the root motion character.

 In order to demonstrate my game meets requirements, the grader will have to start up the game, try each button, and collect the ball with the root motion character.

 The main scene is GameMenuScene.
